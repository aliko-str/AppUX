									You are a student and are looking for a 4-month internship position – doing an internship in a good place outside Italy would be a huge plus on your CV. Getting in such a place is hard. Your thesis supervisor worked in London for a while and has agreed to give you a recommendation letter to a few companies there. Googling “London IT Companies, professor [Name]” retrieved a list of websites. You can only email one company at a time – be extra careful, consider websites and rearrange the list, so the companies you want to get in the most are on the top.
